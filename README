The Power API prototype is a work in progress. It is being used to test
concepts and it: 
1) does not provide complete coverage of the Power API, 
2) has not been tested beyond the examples,
3) has been compiled/tested on a limited number of Operating Systems, and
4) takes liberties with respect to coding.

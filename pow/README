This directory contains the code for libpow. It has compile dependencies on
TimyXML-2 and ULXMLRPC, which are not included in this distribution.
ULXMLRPC is optional and is only needed if exercising the RPC functionality
of the prototype.

The Makefile is simple and is considered the reference on how to integrate
TinyXML-2 and ULXMLRPC into the build process.

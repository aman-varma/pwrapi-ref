This directory contains simple programs that use the PowerAPI library. 
These programs are written in both C and python.

The PowerAPI library depends on environment variables and a system 
configuration file. 

There are two environment variables that need to be set for non-RPC 
execution of a PowerAPI application, POWERAPI_LOCATION and POWERAPI_ROOT.
POWERAPI_LOCATION tells the PowerAPI library what system configuration file
to use.  POWERAPI_ROOT tells the PowerAPI library its entry point.        

The PowerAPI library and the plugins are implemented as dynamic libraries and 
in order for the libraries to be found during execution either LD_LIBRARY_PATH
or DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH must be set.
 
"run_dummy.sh" sets the appropriate environment variables and runs dummyTest.
"run_dummy.sh" is the reference for how to configure the environment. 

"dummyTest" exercises the dummy plugin and is not reliant on specific hardware
or system software as other plugins. It should run on any platform.

This directory contains the code for libpow. It has compile dependencies on
TimyXML-2 and ULXMLRPC, which are not included in this distribution.
ULXMLRPC is optional and is only needed if exercising the client/server
functionality of the prototype.

The Makefile is simple and is considered the reference on how to integrate
TinyXML-2 and ULXMLRPC into the build process.

When inspecting the code in this directory the place to start is pwr.h and 
pwrtypes.h. These two files should mirror what is defined in the Power API 
specifaction document.

This code is written in C++ with C bindings located in pow.cc.

The library has debug support in that you can enable diagnostic printouts.
To enable debug you must modify the Makefile and set DEBUG=y. One can also
specify the level of debug by setting _DbgFlag in cntxt.cc.

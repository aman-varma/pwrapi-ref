This directory contains the code for a daemon that executes PowerAPI calls on 
behalf of a client. The daemon was created as a proof of concept of how a
distributed PowerAPI might work. There are only a handful of PowerAPI calls
implemented.

The IPC mechanism is ULXMLRPC. ULXMLRPC is not included in this package. To 
build this code you must install ULXMLRPC and modify the Makefile so it
"points" to your ULXMLRPC install.

The result of the build is the executable, "server". "server" is no different
than any other application that uses the PowerAPI in that it needs to have
environment variables set and a configuration file. See the examples directory
for more information on running a PowerAPI application.

This directory also contains a Python wrapper for the PowerAPI. The build is 
dependent on libpwr and produces pypwr.so and pypwr.py.  

To use the Python wrapper, the environment variable PYTHONPATH must be set to 
this directory.

The Python wrapper is not fully implemented.
